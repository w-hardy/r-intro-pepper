This site contains short, practical tutorials to help PEPPER group members build skills in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) using [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/?sid=1) and [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/) in [tidyverse-style code](https://style.tidyverse.org/).
[Here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) is a useful guide to installing R and RStudio.

Working through the tutorials here may be useful for those new to R, particularly in preparation for working through the [R for Health Technology Assessment](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/online/r-hta/) text book if the contents of [Chapter 2: Introduction to R](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/online/r-hta/chapters/03.software/software) is new. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) will provide a much more comprehensive instruction on using R. 

# Using each chapter

Each chapter will have an introduction and sections for different actions you may wish to carry out. For each action there will be three tabs: Example, Exercise, and Solution. The example will show you how to perform the task; the exercise will provide a template, with sections missing for you to fill in as practice; and the solution will provide the solution to the exercise so you can check (a) your code and (b) your output.

Start with the first chapter or browse all tutorials from the sidebar.

:::{.callout-note}
These tutorials are not meant to be comprehensive and there will also be other ways to achieve the same goal. The intention is to help people start using R for their work and perhaps find common ways of performing regular tasks. This site should develop and grow over time.
