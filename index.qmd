This site contains short, practical tutorials to help PEPPER group members build skills in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) using [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/?sid=1) and [tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/) in [tidyverse-style code](https://style.tidyverse.org/.
[Here](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) is a useful guide to installing R and RStudio.

Working through the tutorials here may be useful for those new to R, particually in preparation for working through the [R for Health Technology Assessment](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/online/r-hta/) text book if the contents of [Chapter 2: Introduction to R](https://gianluca.statistica.it/books/online/r-hta/chapters/03.software/software) is new.

Start with the first chapter or browse all tutorials from the sidebar.
