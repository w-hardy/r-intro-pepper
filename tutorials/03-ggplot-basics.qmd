We will plot the grouped means from the previous tutorial.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)

summary_tbl <- tibble(
  group = c("A","B","C"),
  mean_value = c(4.67, 5.00, 4.00)
)

summary_tbl |>
  ggplot(aes(x = group, y = mean_value)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(mean_value, 2)), vjust = -0.4) +
  labs(
    x = "Group",
    y = "Mean value",
    title = "Mean by group"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
