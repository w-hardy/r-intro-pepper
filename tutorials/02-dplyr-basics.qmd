We will create a small data frame and compute grouped summaries.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)

df <- tibble(
  id = 1:8,
  group = c("A","A","B","B","B","A","C","C"),
  value = c(3, 5, 2, 9, 4, 6, 1, 7)
) |>
  clean_names()

summary_tbl <- df |>
  group_by(group) |>
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_value = mean(value),
    sd_value = sd(value),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(mean_value))

summary_tbl
